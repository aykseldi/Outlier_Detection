# Outlier Detection and Game Outcome Prediction
 In this project, we analyze the NBA (National Basketball Association) statistics data for predicting the **game outcome and detecting outliers**.
 1. **Outlier Detection**
 
    Our aim is finding the players which break apart from ordinary or standard ones. Our outlier dataset variables are greater than one (1) so we focus on multivariate outliers.
    
    A. **Analyzing Dataset**
    
    The dataset is formed from 5 different parts. These are;
    
        * Statistics of players in regular season (19113 records), 
        * Statistics in playoff season (7544 records), 
        * Statistics in all-star season (1463 records), 
        * Statistics in playoff career (2055 records) and 
        * Statistic in regular season career (3760 records).
        
    In data exploration, there are 19 features in each dataset and **3 of them are nominal**. These features are **playerâ€™s id, name and last name** so these nominal features are not taken into consideration throughout analysis. The remaining features are scaled into 0 to 1 in order to standardize independent variables. 
    
     Furthermore in data preparation stage, other features in the dataset was comprised of sums of all scores so in order to **avoid  most  played player to be a natural outlier, we divide all the scores of players into match played**.
 
In the case of dimensionality reduction on player_playoff_career data, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is applied. Because PCA takes lower dimensional set of features from a higher dimensional dataset while capturing as much information as possible. For PCA results of Playoff career dataset is shown below.




| __PCA__ | __Variance__ | __Cumulative Variance__ |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| PCA1        | 0.502874     | 50.29    |
| PCA2         | 0.192634  | 69.55      |
| PCA3    | 0.126686 | 82.22 |
| PCA4        | 0.0461349  | 86.83     |
| PCA5    | 0.0338315 | 90.21|
| PCA6         | 0.0235394  | 92.56 |
| PCA7    | 0.0223254 | 94.79 |
| PCA8         | 0.0169766 | 96.49     |
| PCA9    | 0.0149214| 97.98 |


*First 7 principle components captures nearly 95% of variance in dataset*.

  B.**Outlier Detection Alghorithms**
  
  Different outlier detection algorithms are used, these are;
 
  |  |Algorithm  Name |
------------ | -------------
 | 1. | Feature Bagging Outlier Detection|
 | 2. | Isolation Forest|
 | 3. | k-Nearest Neighbors Detector|
 | 4. | Cluster-based Local Outlier Detection|
 | 5. | Average K-NN |
 
 
   Feature Bagging Detector
      
   It fits a number of base detectors. It uses base estimator as Local Outlier Factor as default but other estimators such as k-NN or Angle Based Outlier Detector could be user.
   
   In playoff career dataset, there are 20 outliers and 2036 Inliers. Threshold value is **-0.7118109714421073**.
   
   In playoff season dataset, there are 33 outliers and 4430 inliers. Threshold value is **-6231948.694033984**.
